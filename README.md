# Employee Satisfaction Survey Statistical Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee satisfaction survey data to identify key factors influencing overall employee satisfaction. Statistical analysis and data visualization techniques are used to derive insights from Likert-scale survey responses.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- MS Excel  
- Python  
- pandas  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of employee survey responses collected on a Likert scale. Each column represents a survey question, including an overall satisfaction score.

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Imported survey data into Excel and Python  
- Calculated descriptive statistics such as mean and variance  
- Conducted correlation analysis with overall satisfaction  
- Visualized correlations using a heatmap  

## 📈 Results & Visualization
A correlation heatmap was generated to identify the strongest relationships between overall satisfaction and other survey factors.

## ▶ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook  
3. Ensure the CSV file is in the same folder  
4. Run all cells to generate analysis and heatmap
